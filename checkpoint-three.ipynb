These rounds will be very informative for future contestants and therefore, not removed or filled because filling to 0 would skew the data.\n",

I may create an additional column that corresponds to round data, but code them so I can run arithematic functions. For example, Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, Final Jeopardy!, and Tiebreaker correspond to 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. I don't think it will be wise to replace which is why I'd create an additional column. I'd like to determine overarching categories for the Questions and then drill farther into each category. For example, an overarching category could be Sports, then drilling down, those could separate into Baseball, Basketball, Football, etc., then separate into questions about Players, Tournaments, Rules of Sport, etc. It will also be interesting to see if there are any trends with the number of clues in each Round that were able to be answered. Frequently, there are clues left on the board as time has run out. I could also create a new column to indicate whether a Question was a Daily Double. \n"
